## Agents 

an LLM-powered system designed to take actions and solve complex tasks autonomously. Unlike traditional LLMs, AI agents go beyond simple text generation. They are equipped with additional capabilities, including:

- Planning and reflection: AI agents can analyze a problem, break it down into steps, and adjust their approach based on new information.  
- Tool access: They can interact with external tools and resources, such as databases, APIs, and software applications, to gather information and execute actions.  
- Memory: AI agents can store and retrieve information, allowing them to learn from past experiences and make more informed decisions.  

### Components

AI agents require three fundamental capabilities to effectively tackle complex tasks: planning abilities, tool utilization, and memory management  

* Planning: The Brain of the Agent  
 - Task decomposition through chain-of-thought reasoning
 - Self-reflection on past actions and information
 - Adaptive learning to improve future decisions
 - Critical analysis of current progress
 
* Tool Utilization  
 - Code interpreters and execution environments
 - Web search and scraping utilities
 - Mathematical calculators
 - Image generation systems

* Memory Systems
 - Short term
 - Long term
