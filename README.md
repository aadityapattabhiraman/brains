### 1. **LeNet-5 (1998)**  
**Authors**: Yann LeCun, LÃ©on Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, Patrick Haffner  
**Goal**: Introduced one of the first convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for digit recognition on the MNIST dataset, laying the foundation for CNNs in computer vision.

---

### 2. **AlexNet (2012)**  
**Authors**: Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, Geoffrey Hinton  
**Goal**: Revolutionized image classification using deep networks with GPU acceleration, winning the 2012 ImageNet competition.

---

### 3. **GoogLeNet (Inception) (2014)**  
**Authors**: Christian Szegedy, Wei Liu, Yangqing Jia, et al.  
**Goal**: Introduced the **Inception module**, which uses parallel convolution filters of different sizes, making the network both deeper and more efficient.

---

### 4. **VGGNet (2014)**  
**Authors**: Karen Simonyan, Andrew Zisserman  
**Goal**: Introduced deeper CNN architectures (with small 3x3 filters), demonstrating the importance of depth in improving performance for image classification.

---

### 5. **ResNet (2015)**  
**Authors**: Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, Jian Sun  
**Goal**: Introduced **residual connections** (skip connections) to facilitate training of deeper networks and address the vanishing gradient problem.

---

### 6. **Fast R-CNN (2015)**  
**Authors**: Ross B. Girshick  
**Goal**: Improved R-CNN by sharing convolutional features and introducing **RoI pooling** for faster and more efficient object detection.

---

### 7. **Faster R-CNN (2015)**  
**Authors**: Shaoqing Ren, Kaiming He, Ross B. Girshick, Jian Sun  
**Goal**: Introduced **Region Proposal Networks (RPN)**, eliminating the need for external region proposals, speeding up object detection.

---

### 8. **YOLO: You Only Look Once (2016)**  
**Authors**: Joseph Redmon, Santosh Divvala, Ross Girshick, Ali Farhadi  
**Goal**: Introduced a unified approach for real-time object detection, where both classification and bounding box prediction are performed in a single forward pass.

---

### 9. **SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector (2016)**  
**Authors**: Wei Liu, Andrechen Anguelov, Dingfu Xu, et al.  
**Goal**: Proposed a **single-shot** object detection method, making it faster and more efficient than two-stage detectors like Faster R-CNN.

---

### 10. **ResNet-152 (2016)**  
**Authors**: Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, Jian Sun  
**Goal**: An extension of ResNet with 152 layers, pushing the boundaries of deeper neural networks to achieve state-of-the-art performance in image classification tasks.
